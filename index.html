            Hello, my name is <b>Baki Hanma</b>, but you can call me <b>Baki</b>.  
            I’m from Tokyo, Japan, and I’m currently 18 years old.  
            My birthday is <u>September 4, 2000</u>.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:18px;">
            I don’t attend a regular school—instead, I dedicate my life to intense martial arts training and underground fighting.  
            I’m the youngest champion of the <i>Tokyo Dome Underground Arena</i>, where only the strongest warriors compete in secret no-rules matches.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:18px;">
            My mother’s name is <s>Emi Akezawa</s>, a wealthy woman who raised me to be strong, hoping I would impress my father.  
            My father is <s>Yuujirou Hanma</s>, also known as <b>“The Ogre”</b>, considered the strongest creature on Earth.  
            He’s my biggest rival and the reason I strive to grow stronger every day.  
            I also have a half-brother named <mark>Jack Hanma</mark>, who shares my father’s blood and the same drive to surpass him.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:18px;">
            I’ve been training in martial arts since childhood.  
            I’m skilled in many disciplines including grappling, boxing, karate, and judo, and I’ve developed superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and reflexes.  
            I can even manipulate my brain chemicals to boost my performance in battle.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:18px;">
            My hobbies include combat training, meditation, and challenging powerful opponents.  
            I rarely rest because I believe that pain, pressure, and hardship are the keys to becoming stronger.  
            I also enjoy simple pleasures like quiet moments, time with friends, and occasionally training in nature or extreme environments.
